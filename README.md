MITx 6.00.2 Problem Set Code

                                                  HELLO EVERYONE !!!!!
                                                  
This is a repo dedicated to help those who are taking MIT's edX course : 6.00.2x-Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science! I will be adding frequently the code needed for the problem sets! I encourage you to read the code many times till you fully understand it and not blindly copy and paste it! Any comments or suggestions are all welcome!!!

P.S. Some parts of the problem set 5 code which refers to graphs are not entirely correct so don't copy and paste them. I will upload them in case you need some help getting started with this problem set.  If you have corrected/improved my code please be kind to share it here and i will post it!
